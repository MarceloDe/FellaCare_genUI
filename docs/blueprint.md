# **App Name**: MediMate

## Core Features:

- Landing Page UI: Landing Page: Presents a clean, white canvas-style interface inspired by the Meta app, with a fixed chat interface at the bottom.
- Chat Interface: Modern Chat Interface: Includes icons for image uploads and voice conversations, fixed at the bottom of the landing page.
- Dynamic UI with LLM: Generative UI Rendering: The LLM renders dynamic UI elements (clickable text, text areas) on the canvas, driven by user selections. It includes a 'tool' to decide how to integrate various user prompts in rendering.
- Action Suggestions: Suggested Actions: Displays prompts above the chat interface to guide user interaction, such as 'Let's start with: Upload your insurance card?'
- Menu Design: Menu Navigation: Features a metal design browser menu (hamburger icon) at the top-left for navigation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 210, 100%, 62% (Hex: #33A6FF). This vivid blue evokes trust and confidence, aligning with the supportive function of the app. Avoids cliches like greens, and feels contemporary.
- Background color: HSL 210, 15%, 95% (Hex: #F0F5FA). A very light tint of blue provides a subtle backdrop that is clean and unobtrusive.
- Accent color: HSL 180, 75%, 50% (Hex: #00BFA5). A contrasting cyan-green draws attention to interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, provides a modern and neutral aesthetic suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons for chat functions and navigation.
- Emulate the Meta app layout, focusing on a clean, white background and a prominent, fixed chat interface.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations for UI elements to enhance user experience.
